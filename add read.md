# Renewable Energy Output Forecasting

![Energy Forecasting Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Renewable+Energy+Forecasting+Workflow)
> Accurate prediction of renewable energy generation using machine learning

This project provides a robust pipeline for forecasting renewable energy output (solar/wind) using weather data and historical generation patterns. The system employs both tree-based models (XGBoost) and sequence models (LSTM) to predict energy generation with high accuracy.

## Key Features
- 🌀 Synthetic data generation for renewable energy systems
- ⚡ Hybrid modeling approach (XGBoost + LSTM)
- 📈 Advanced feature engineering (temporal features, lag features, interactions)
- 🔍 Comprehensive model evaluation and visualization
- 🚀 Production-ready pipeline architecture
- 📊 Interactive result visualizations
